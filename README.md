This repository contains the official resources for **HOI-R1**, a research project that explores the potential of **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** for **Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Detection**.

HOI-R1 is inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models and investigates how vision-language models can reason about and detect human-object interactions more effectively.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Task**: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOID)
- **Our Motivation**:  
  Leverage the reasoning capability of Multimodal LLMs and reinforcement learning–style optimization to explore HOI detection performance.
